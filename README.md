# Snake!
##  [Play it here](https://jesses-snake.netlify.app/)

A re-creation of a mobile classic! Pressing a space bar initializes a new game and the arrow keys/direction buttons begin movement. Direct the snake to as many apples as possible, without touching the sides or the snake's body. Travel back to the year 2000 and play on your phone, users can change their button layout to accomodate either lefties or righties.
